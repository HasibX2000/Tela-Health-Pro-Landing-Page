	TelahealthPro respects the privacy concerns of the Users and therefore provides this privacy
policy to explain what information is gathered during a visit to the site and how such information
may be used.
<br /><br />
<div class="h4">1. Use of Information</div>
<br />

As a general policy, no personal information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is
automatically collected from your visit to our site. However, certain non-personal information is
recorded by the standard operation of the TelahealthPro internet servers. Information such as the
type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to
enhance your telemedicine experience.
<br /><br />
<div class="h4">2. Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices</div>
<br />

THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE
USED, AND DISCLOSED, AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.
PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.
The Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal program
requiring that all medical records and other individually identifiable health information used, or
disclosed, by us in any form, whether electronically, on paper, or orally, are kept properly
confidential. This Act gives you, the Patient, significant new rights to understand and control
how your health information is used. HIPAA provides penalties for covered entities that misuse
personal health information.
We have prepared this "Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices" to explain how we are required to
maintain the privacy of your health information and how we may use and disclose your health
information.
We may use and disclose your medical records for each of the following purposes: treatment,
payment, and health care operations:
TREATMENT means providing, coordinating, or managing health care and related services by
one or more health care providers.
PAYMENT means such activities as obtaining payment or reimbursement for services, billing or
collection activities and utilization review.

HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS include managing your Electronic Medical Record to facilitate
diagnostic medical consultations with associated physicians, as well as conducting quality
assessment review and service improvement planning activities, auditing functions, costcontainment analysis, and customer service.
We may also create and distribute de-identified health information by removing all references to
individually identifiable information.
We may contact you to provide information about our services or other health-related services
that may be of interest to you.
Any other uses and disclosures will be made only with your written authorization. You may
revoke such authorization in writing and we are required to honor and abide by that written
request, except to the extent that we have already taken actions relying on your authorization.
<br /><br />
<div class="h4">3. Access to and Control over Personal Information</div>
<br />

At any time or as otherwise required under applicable law, users may contact TelahealthPro to
review the personal information that TelahealthPro has collected about you. If you discover any
errors, please notify TelahealthPro and the information will be corrected. If you wish to delete
your user account, please contact us and we shall proceed to delete the account.
